### Manager User Ticket Filtering
**Feature:** Implemented role-based ticket filtering for Manager users (role_id = 3) to show only tickets assigned to their agents.

#### Changes Made:

1. **Tickets List Page** (`app/Http/Controllers/TicketController.php`)
   - Updated `index()` method (lines 52-66)
   - Added logic to retrieve assigned agent IDs from `assign_agents` table for logged-in manager
   - Implemented `whereHas` with `whereIn` to filter tickets by assigned agents
   - Returns empty result set if manager has no assigned agents

2. **Deleted Tickets Page** (`app/Http/Controllers/TicketController.php`)
   - Updated `trashed()` method (lines 517-531)
   - Applied same filtering logic as tickets list
   - Ensures soft-deleted tickets are filtered by manager's assigned agents

3. **Verify Tickets Page**
   - No direct changes needed
   - Automatically benefits from `index()` method changes
   - Frontend calls `/tickets` endpoint with `status: 4` parameter
   - Client-side filtering for `verified_at = null` remains unchanged

#### Technical Implementation:
```php
// Manager filtering logic
if ($user->role_id == 3) {
    $assignedAgentIds = \DB::table('assign_agents')
        ->where('user_id', $user->id)
        ->pluck('agent_id')
        ->toArray();

    if (!empty($assignedAgentIds)) {
        $query->whereHas('agent', function($q) use ($assignedAgentIds) {
            $q->whereIn('agent_id', $assignedAgentIds);
        });
    } else {
        $query->whereRaw('1 = 0');
    }
}
```

#### Impact:
- Manager users now see only tickets assigned to agents they manage
- Consistent filtering across all three ticket views: main list, deleted tickets, and verify tickets
- Maintains existing functionality for Admin, Agent, and Branch Admin roles

#### Files Modified:
- `app/Http/Controllers/TicketController.php`

#### Build Status:
